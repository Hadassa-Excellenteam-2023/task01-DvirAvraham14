Introduction:
In this task, we will implement a Vector class and a Stack class, both of which will use manual memory management, 
special functions in the class, and loading operators (operator overloading). The Vector class will represent a vector
that holds integer type elements, and the Stack class will be a stack for integers that uses the Vector class

Conclusion:
This task will provide practice in manual memory management, special functions in the class, and loading operators 
(operator overloading). By implementing the Vector and Stack classes, we will learn how to differentiate between size
and capacity, optimize memory usage, and implement various operators to manipulate the data.
